# ShortestJobsFirst_Bash

This is a bash implementation of the SJF (Shortest Jobs First) algorithm that I created for my Operating Systems class a few years ago.
As of now, I'm working on refactoring to create a more readable and efficient version.

The script will generate an input and an output directory which will store the files for future execution or analysis. The util directory
contains an example file of the input to follow for the automatic input of data.
The first line are the partitions (identified by order and size)
The following lines describe the processes attributes.

If you decide to input data manually, that data will be stored in the input file for future executions.
